Rules: 
● Two players take turns dropping red and yellow coloured discs into the 
chosen columns in a 6-row×7-column grid. 
● The disc falls to the lowest available space in the chosen column. 
● At the start of each turn, the opponent selects one column to block. The 
current player is not allowed to drop a disc into the blocked column during 
that turn. 
Example: 
❖ It's Player 1's turn. 
❖ Player 2 blocks column 4. 
❖ Player 1 cannot drop their disc into column 4 for that turn. 
After blocking, there must be at least one available column where the 
current player can drop a disc. If not, then no column should be blocked for 
that turn. 
● The goal is to connect 4 discs of the same colour - vertically, horizontally, 
or diagonally. 
● The first player to do so wins. If the board fills up without any winner, then 
it’s a draw.

● Implement the game with the above mentioned rules.

wins.

storage to persist scores/statistics across sessions.

time, extra turn for the player, etc). You can include your own custom 
power-ups also.

disable sound effects.
